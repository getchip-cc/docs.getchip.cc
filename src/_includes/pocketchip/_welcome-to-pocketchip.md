# Welcome to PocketC.H.I.P. 

![PocketC.H.I.P. Front](images/front-and-back.png)

Hey! Thanks for checking out **PocketC.H.I.P.**!

**PocketC.H.I.P.** is a game console, a portable synthesizer, and a Linux field terminal. With a bit of effort, it can become a whole lot more â€“ see PockulusC.H.I.P., PocketC.H.I.P. as a VR headset [here](http://pockulus.getchip.com/). 

The point is, **PocketC.H.I.P. can be what you want it to be** and we're excited to see what you will do with your PocketC.H.I.P..

These are the **Docs**, which are intended to help you get started with PocketC.H.I.P.. The Docs will introduce you to the software that comes pre-installed on PocketC.H.I.P., explain how to use the system, and hopefully plant some ideas about how you can do even more with your PocketC.H.I.P..

The Docs will *not* teach you how to code (though it will give tips), how to program a game (though it will explain the tools), how to make music (though it will describe options), or how to build onto PocketC.H.I.P. (though it be encouraged).

**Have fun!**

# Quick Start
This section explains how to **turn on PocketC.H.I.P.**, **setup WiFi**, and **charge your device**. 

![Step 1](images/image_1.png)

**Turn on PocketC.H.I.P.** by pressing down the **Home/Power button** located at the bottom in the middle of the keyboard for about **two seconds**. 

**PocketC.H.I.P.** will take a moment to fully load, but while it does you will see the C.H.I.P. logo and then a PocketC.H.I.P. splash screen. 

Once PocketC.H.I.P. is ready you will see a series of slides showing the PocketC.H.I.P. basics. Use the **right arrow key** or **tap the right side of the screen** to advance forward in the slideshow.

Once you have clicked through the basics, you will see a screen with six icons. This is the **Home Screen**.

Use a **finger** or **stylus** (or really anything that's solid and isn't sharp) to tap on the application you want to use. Press gently enough to make contact with the screen. There's no need to apply a lot of force. A gentle touch will do.

While using an application, **press the Home/Power button to return to the Home Screen**.

### WiFi Setup

From the Home Screen, tap the **settings icon** in the bottom right corner to access the Settings Screen. 

Press the button to the right of the WiFi toggle switch to open a menu of all the networks in range. Scroll through the list and select your network by pressing the arrows above and below the network names. To refresh the network list, just exit the list and enter again. 

When prompted, enter the network password in the text field, then touch the **Connect** button. It may take a few seconds to connect.

### Charging

**Plug in PocketC.H.I.P.** to a **5-volt 1.5A power** supply with a USB-micro cable to charge the **3.7V battery**.

Because it is C.H.I.P.'s on-board circuitry that manages the charging of PocketC.H.I.P.'s battery, the **C.H.I.P. must remain attached to PocketC.H.I.P. for battery charging**.

PocketC.H.I.P. is **compatible with most cell phone chargers** that use a USB-micro cable.

### Troubleshooting

If PocketC.H.I.P. becomes unresponsive, **hold down the Home/Power button for eight seconds**. This will cut power to PocketC.H.I.P., and immediately shut it down. Only use this shutdown method if no other shutdown methods work.
