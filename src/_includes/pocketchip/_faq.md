# FAQ

**Can I take C.H.I.P. out of PocketC.H.I.P. and use it?**

At this time, it will not work as expected without reflashing. The C.H.I.P.s in PocketC.H.I.P. run a custom graphics software that's designed for the touchscreen and PocketC.H.I.P. keyboard. C.H.I.P. may boot, but the resolution and input will not work as expected.

**Is it Legal to Modify PocketC.H.I.P.?**

Yes. PocketC.H.I.P. and C.H.I.P. are open source hardware. We encourage you to modify PocketC.H.I.P. and be sure to share what you've done with our community!

**Is PocketC.H.I.P. Open Source?**

Yes, and you can get the hardware files at our [github repo](https://github.com/NextThingCo/PocketCHIP-PCB).

**Will my microUSB charger work with PocketC.H.I.P.?**

PocketC.H.I.P. is compatible with most cell phone chargers that use a USB-micro cable. PocketC.H.I.P. needs a power supply capable of outputting 5-volts with at least 1 amp.

**Will my Bluetooth device work?**

Yes, so long as the device is supported under Debian Linux. However, you will need to setup the bluetooth pairing using the terminal [here](/chip.html#connecting-bluetooth-devices). Our initial release of PocketC.H.I.P. does not provide graphical bluetooth configuration.

Your screen is fine. The resistive touchscreen used in PocketC.H.I.P. does not support pinch gestures.

**How can I get PockulusC.H.I.P.?**

Good news! You already almost have one. All you need to do is 3D print the file found [here](https://github.com/NextThingCo/PockulusCHIP). If you do not own a 3D printer find a friend to do it for you.
