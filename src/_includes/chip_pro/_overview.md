C.H.I.P. Pro is powered by Next Thing Coâ€™s GR8 SiP (System in Package). GR8 features a 1GHz Allwinner R8 ARMv7 Cortex-A8 processor with NEON SIMD extensions and a Mali-400 GPU. 256MB of Nanya DDR3 SDRAM is combined with the R8 processor into a 14mm x 14mm, 0.8mm pitch 252 ball FBGA package. 

In addition to the Mali-400 graphic engine that supports OpenGL ES 1.0 and 2.0. GR8 includes a video engine for encoding and decoding codecs such as VP6/8, AVS, H.264, H.263, MPEG-1/2/4 and a display engine for a hardware cursor, alpha blending, and anti-flicker.

More information about the GR8 SiP can be found in the [GR8 data sheet.](https://github.com/NextThingCo/CHIP_Pro-Hardware/raw/master/Datasheets/GR8_Datasheet_v1.0.pdf)
