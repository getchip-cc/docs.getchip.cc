## How much does GR8 cost?
Gr8 costs $6 in any quantity.  

## Where can I purchase GR8?
Contact us at [sales@nextthing.co](mailto:sales@nextthing.co) to tell us more about your product and to set up a purchase order.

## What are GR8’s dimensions?
14mm x 14mm x 0.8mm

## What is the GR8 package?
GR8 is built within a 252 ball FBGA (Fine Pitch Ball Grid Array) package, 0.8mm pitch.

## I have a prototype of my product, should I choose C.H.I.P. Pro or GR8 to move forward with?

This depends on your product's needs and your company's resources. For most customers, C.H.I.P. Pro will be the best and most convenient way to work with the GR8 SiP. C.H.I.P. Pro contains 127 already sourced components including a power management unit (PMU), micro USB port, WiFi, Bluetooth and more. 

If you have tried C.H.I.P. Pro and have found that you need a different layout and different functionality, then designing a custom PCB around GR8 is a great option. You can find out everything that GR8 has to offer in the GR8 [datasheet](https://github.com/NextThingCo/CHIP_Pro-Hardware/tree/master/Datasheets).

## I'm sourcing components for a custom PCB, which components work with GR8 out of the box?

The best reference for components that are supported by our operating systems out of the box is C.H.I.P. Pro. To see if they are right for your product, datasheets for these components are found in our [C.H.I.P. Pro Hardware](https://github.com/NextThingCo/CHIP_Pro-Hardware) Github repo. 

## What WiFi Modules Does GR8 support?

Technically, a WiFi module supported in Arch Linux ARM and that uses the SDIO (Secure Digital Input Output) V2.0 protocol can be used with GR8. A good reference for components supported by our software is C.H.I.P. Pro which uses the RTL8723DS module.

What module you want to use may also depend on what kind of software support is available. Software drivers for the RTL8723DS module come with our C.H.I.P. Pro operating system making it a go-to choice if you need something that works right away. 

For more information on the SDIO protocol, please refer to the specifications found on page 221 of the [GR8 manual](https://github.com/NextThingCo/CHIP_Pro-Hardware/tree/master/GR8/Manual). 


## I’m a distributor, can I carry GR8?
Yes! Contact us at [sales@nextthing.co](mailto:sales@nextthing.co).
